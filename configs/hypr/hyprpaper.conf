# This file is for configuring hyprpaper, the wallpaper utility for Hyprland.
# The 'preload' command loads the image into memory, and the 'wallpaper' command
# applies it to a monitor.

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# Change the path below to the actual location of your wallpaper file.
# The `default.png` is just a placeholder name.
preload = ~/.config/assets/backgrounds/d.png
wallpaper = ,~/.config/assets/backgrounds/d.png

# The first value in 'wallpaper = ...' is for a specific monitor.
# Leaving it blank (like here) means it will apply to all monitors.
# To set it for a specific monitor, use:
# wallpaper = DP-2,~/.config/assets/backgrounds/dracula-wallpaper.png
